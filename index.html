      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a WA State i502 recreational cannabis grower learning a new skill. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Washington, I've never left my hometown but I look forward to moving to a new state in the next couple of years.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Hanging out with my family will always be my favorite thing to do. I love pretty much all outdoor activities. I love to garden, cook, read, and craft.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to work for a traceability company to help make better systems for the industry I love, or create/maintain websites for producer/processors and stores.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Sedro Woolley, WA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>While I love growing, I need a change of career. My body cannot handle the physical aspects of growing on commercial scale full time forever. What better way to increase my payscale and remain in the industry I love. With the right knowledge there are many possibilities for me after graduation.</p>
